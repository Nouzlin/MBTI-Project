\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

This work shows that, with appropriate filtering, the Myers-Briggs type indicator can be predicted from written text with a test set accuracy of 30.3\%.
The best model uses a Gradient Boosting classifier with a topic distribution over 16 topics as a feature vector.
The result was achieved with the help of extensive parameter tuning.
However, several limitations exist and there are many potential improvements to be explored and implemented.
