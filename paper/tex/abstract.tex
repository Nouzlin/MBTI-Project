\begin{abstract}
    The Extra Trees, Logistic Regression, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting and Linear SVC classifiers are used to predict the Myers-Briggs type of a user.
    The models are tested with features extracted from the latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model, TF-IDF and bag-of-letters models.
    The Gradient Boosting Classifier achieves the best performance with a test accuracy of 30.3\%.
    Improvements to the models are proposed and the limitations of the data set are discussed.
