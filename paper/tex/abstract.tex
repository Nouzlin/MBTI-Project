    This work experiments with supervised learning classifiers to predict the Myers-Briggs type of a user based on written text.
    The models are tested with features extracted from the latent Dirichlet allocation model, the TF-IDF model and the bag-of-letters model.
    The Gradient Boosting Classifier is shown to achieve the best performance with a test accuracy of 30.3\%.
    Improvements to the classifiers are proposed and the limitations of the data set are discussed.
