\section{Introduction}

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator has under the past few years come under heavy criticism \cite{pittenger1993, grant-mbti, rose-mbti, bbc-mbti, winkie-mbti}.
However, it is still a popular \cite{MBTI-trend} personality trait indicator.
This work aims to explore if text written by an individual can be used to predict the Myers-Briggs type for that individual.
It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and supervised learning methods.
Section \ref{sec:theory} briefly explains the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, common NLP techniques and machine learning models used.
Related work is presented in Section \ref{sec:related-work}.
The method is covered in Section \ref{sec:method} and the results from the method is presented in Section \ref{sec:results} and Appendix \ref{appendix:results}.
The results and limitations in the work are discussed in Section \ref{sec:discussion}.
The conclusions from this work are present in Section \ref{sec:conclusion} and potential future work is discussed in Section \ref{sec:future-work}.
