\section{Related Work} \label{sec:related-work}

In \cite{maneural}, Ma et al. train Neural Networks (NNs) to predict Myers-Briggs personality types based on the writing style.
The data used in \cite{maneural} was manually crafted by generating a mapping between famous authors and their MBTI.
The text in books written by the authors were then retrieved and used in the work.
The best accuracy obtained by Ma et al. was 37\%, using a Recurrent NN with long short-term memory (LSTM).
